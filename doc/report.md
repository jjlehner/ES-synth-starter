# Application  of  Real-Time  Programming Techniques
The tasks of the music synthesiser must appear to operate in parallel which can be achieved through threading and interrupts - FreeRTOS enables a threading model to be easily implemented by using Tasks and a task scheduler to achieve this, and a hardware timer for interrupts is given by the standard Arduino library. 

## Threading
In our implementation, the threaded tasks are defined in the Tasks library with each task being started within the setup of the main thread to improve maintainability of the codebase. Each task is initiated by the setup with a predefined and tuned stack size by use of the FreeRTOS macro `uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark`, which helps determining the minimum unused memory throughout the runtime. Each task operates its own well defined functionality, this is divided up into the `scanKeysTask`,`displayUpdateTask`,`decodeTask` and `transmitTask`. 

| Task | Stack Size /32 bit words |
|--|--|
|scanKeys| 128|
|displayUpdate| 256 |
|decodeTask| 64|
|transmit Task| 64|


The `scanKeysTask` reads the values directly from the input "keyMatrix" and produces a `std::bitset` with the values flat-packed, which is then used to detect localised key state changes to enable efficient transmission by pushing these changes to a ThreadSafeList data-structure which makes use of a critical section to enable safe concurrent access, the task also updates values stored in the global Knob objects for their specific rotation.

The `displayUpdateTask` makes use of the ThreadSafeList data-structure to read the first note pressed and display it on the u8g2 display with also concurrent reads to the global knob objects to display the volume, octave and current wave mode. When measuring the execution times, improving performance per iteration of this task was not possible as the largest bottleneck is the `sendBuffer` method which is expected due to the large memory transfers.

The `decodeTask` makes use of the ThreadSafeList data-structure and pushes data into the notesPressed with modified octave if a new note is pressed, and otherwise removes the note from the ThreadSafeList. Messages arrive through the CAN bus and trigger an interrupt which fills a thread-safe queue, that is then processed by this task and removed from the queue.

The `transmitTask` also makes use of a `msgOutQ` queue to execute its loop body by decrementing the counting semaphore to ensure no messages are lost due to concurrency bugs, which is then released by the `CAN_TX_ISR` as it pushes out data onto the CAN bus.

## Interrupts
The music synthesiser also makes use of hardware interrupts for fast, hardware parallelism triggered by events in order to handle both the messaging on the CAN bus and the speaker control using the `SampleISR`, as an interrupt service routine that is triggered at a rate of 22kHz.

## Thread-Safe Data Exchange

### Generic ThreadSafeList\<T>
A global list named 'KeysPressed' was required to contain which keys were being pressed on the keyboard. This list was used by multiple tasks. It was decided to wrap this global list in a generic ThreadSafeList type. Further information can be found on the methods which guarantee safe access and synchronisation in the [ListSafeList\<T> documenation](https://link-url-here.org)


### Inter-Task Blocking

The `ThreadSafeList` `notePressed` is shared between the SampleISR interrupt and three tasks: ScanKey Task, UpdateDisplay Take and the Decode Task. The `ThreadSafeList` prevents both race conditions and deadlock by wrapping list mutations in critical section block. Using muteces in this data structure would not allow the type to be accessed in both interrupts and threads, as an interrupt could not yield to a thread holding a lock on the underlying list type causing deadlock. Critical section overcome the potential deadlock of muteces in this situation by disabling interrupts and context switches for short sections of code. In essence this makes short sections of code atomic as by calling ```taskENTER_CRITICAL()``` FreeRTOS guarantees a critical section will remain in the running state until the critical section is exited by calling ```taskEXIT_CRITICAL()```.

# Execution Times, Initiation Intervals & CPU Utilisation
Execution Time (ET) is defined as the time spent using processing resources (the CPU) by a task (block of code) in a thread. Initiation Interval (II) is the time taken between sequential initiations of said task.

To get both of these, we used software measurements. We start the timer at the initialisation of the task and calculate the time it takes to complete. We then average over multiple iterations.

In this section, we will outline and analyse both the ET and II of each thread. The results will then be used in next section in order to perform a critical instant analysis of the rate monotonic scheduler, showing that all deadlines are met under worst-case conditions as well as computing the CPU utilisation.

The task IIs were determined in the following manner:
- Sample ISR: The specifications say that sound should be emitted with a frequency of 22 kHz, which translates to an II of around 0.045 milliseconds (referring to: Period = 1/frequency = 1/22 kHz).
- CAN TX ISR: The instructions (page 10 / Lab 2) state that the transmit task must trigger in the worst case at a 1.67 ms interval. Since this task is extremely lightweight (takes around 3 microseconds to complete), its load is very small.
- Scan Keys Task: Design choice to use a 20 millisecond polling time. This helps getting better feedback from the knobs and the keys, while putting a comparatively small load on the system's resources.
- Message Decode Task: 25.5 milliseconds, see analysis in the lab notes (page 10 / Lab 2).
- Message Transmit Task: 60 milliseconds, see analysis in the lab notes (page 10 / Lab 2).
- Display Update Task: The specification (point 5) state that the display and the LD3 LED on the MCU need to be updated every 100 milliseconds.

The following is an analysis for a sawtooth wave where a maximum of 4 keys can be pressed at one time. It is possible to allow 5 keys to be pressed at one time, but this lowers the margin to around that of the sine wave at one pressed key. The bottom right cell of the table below reveals a CPU utilisation of around 92%.

| Task | Priority | Initiation Interval $\tau_i$ [ms] | Execution Time $T_i$ [ms]| $\left\lceil \dfrac{\tau_n}{\tau_i}\right\rceil T_i$ [ms]| $\frac{T_i}{\tau_i}$ [%]|
|-------------------|-----|-----------|---------|---------|--------|
Sample ISR Sawtooth | ISR | 0.04545.. | 0.034   | 74.83   | 74.80  | 
CAN TX ISR          | ISR | 1.67      | 0.003   | 0.18    | 0.18   | 
Scan Keys           | 3   | 20        | 0.104   | 0.52    | 0.52   |
Message Decode      | 2   | 25.2      | 0.007   | 0.028   | 0.03   | 
Message Transmit    | 2   | 60        | 0.011   | 0.022   | 0.02   |  
Display Update      | 1   | 100       | 16.667  | 16.67   | 16.67  | 
Total               |     |           |         | 92.25   | 92.21  |

The following is an analysis for a sine wave where a maximum of 1 key can be pressed at one time. The sine wave implementation is more computationally demanding than the sawtooth wave, and thus our implementation can handle fewer pressed keys. The bottom right cell of the table below reveals a CPU utilisation of around 97%.

| Task | Priority | Initiation Interval $\tau_i$ [ms] | Execution Time $T_i$ [ms]| $\left\lceil \dfrac{\tau_n}{\tau_i}\right\rceil T_i$ [ms]| $\frac{T_i}{\tau_i}$ [%] |
|-------------------|-----|-----------|---------|---------|--------|
Sample ISR Sine     | ISR | 0.04545.. | 0.036   | 79.24   | 74.20  | 
CAN TX ISR          | ISR | 1.67      | 0.003   | 0.18    | 0.18   | 
Scan Keys           | 3   | 20        | 0.104   | 0.52    | 0.52   | 
Message Decode      | 2   | 25.2      | 0.007   | 0.028   | 0.03   | 
Message Transmit    | 2   | 60        | 0.011   | 0.022   | 0.02   | 
Display Update      | 1   | 100       | 16.667  | 16.67   | 16.67  | 
Total               |     |           |         | 96.65   | 96.61  |


We can observe from the above table that the Latency Ln (column 5) is always smaller than the initiation time (100ms) of the lowest priority task (Display Update). This shows, by critical instant analysis, that our scheduling works.

# Advanced Features
Polyphony, and variable waveform generation have been implemented by multiple people in parallel, with the aim of producing readable and maintainable code. To this end, we structured our code based on the object-oriented method. This makes interfacing with the code simple for people who have not written it. In that regard, we have opted for a small trade-off between execution speed, by wrapping objects around core functionality, in favour of readability and maintainability. One such example is the `SoundGenerator` class providing a single interface for sound generation, regardless of if multiple keyboards are connected, how many keys are pressed, which waveform is selected, and at which octave the sound should be played. It would be simple to, for example, add an other possible waveform. 

Those advanced features enhance the system's functionality by providing additional methods to produce music. Please note that the speakers of the music synthesiser are poor, and thus do not adapt well to sine waves, the sound can, however, be perceived better using headphones. 

If we had more time, and the hardware had more resources (see the critical instant analysis above), we would have implemented the following functionalities:
- Additional waveforms. The modularity of the system means that if we have a high resolution waveform in memory (see example for a sine wave below), the system can easily be modified to utilise this functionality.
- Support for pressing more keys at the same time. At the moment, this is restricted in software to conserve system resources, but this requires removing one line of code to reverse. 
- Recording and replay functionalities. By recording the duration which keys were pressed, their sound can be saved at a relatively small memory cost. Replayed notes can then use the existing API for replaying the sounds. 

## Polyphony

To perform polyphony, the synthesiser must associate a phase accumulator with each key that is being pressed. Voltage output to the speaker is then calculated by summing each phase accumulator to superimpose the waveforms of all the notes being pressed. To save memory and remove processing time associated with allocating memory, 36 phase accumulators are declared in a static array at the beginning of the program. When a key is pressed, a PhaseAccumulatorPool helper class dynamically assigns one of entry in the accumulator array to store the phase accumulation of a note. Once the same key is released the accumulator pool frees the entry in the array so that another note can be assigned to it. See here for more detailed documentation of the [PhaseAccumulator Pool](PhaseAccPool.md). 
 
## Sine Wave/Saw Tooth  
 The user can choose in real-time to either play with a sawtooth wave or a sine wave through knob 1 (the second knob from the right). A sine wave with $K$ values over a period is given by $g[n] = \sin(2\pi \frac{1}{K} n)$ for $n\in\{1, 2, ..., K\}$. For a large $K$, $g[n]$ is high resolution and a good approximation of a continuous sine. A sine wave $\sin(2\pi f t)$ with frequency $f$ at time $t$ can then be extracted from $g$ by setting $n = K f t \mod K$. We can exploit the periodicity the sine, i.e. $g[n+m] = g[n]$ if $m$ is a multiple of $K$, to generate an infinite sine wave from a single period. In our case, $g$ was generated with the following code (and scaled to  maximum value $128=256/2$):
```python
import numpy as np
K = 1024
ts = np.arange(0,1,1/K)
wave = np.zeros_like(ts)
for i in range(ts.shape[0]):
    wave[i] = 256/2*np.sin(2*np.pi*ts[i])
wave = wave.astype(np.int32)
np.savetxt("sine_wave", wave[None,:], delimiter=',', fmt='%i', newline="")
```
Note that since $\sin(x) = -\sin(x+\pi)$, the memory requirement can be halved at the cost of a larger computational load. In fact, since computational resources in the ISR were scarce, we decided to store a full period in memory to save on some computations. Moreover, note that we can provide a better sine approximation by increasing $K$, but it was found experimentally that values above $250$ provided little improvement - the speaker was not good enough to determine that one waveform was better than another.

Moreover, the time variable can be acquired through the _micros()_ function, which is built-in to the Arduino. The documentation for this function reveals that it overflows after around 70 minutes, however it is unlikely that a human would depress a single key continuously for more than a few seconds at a time, allowing us to discard this limitation.
